.TH setup.types 5 "ESP Package Manager" "March 11, 2020" "Michael R Sweet"
.SH NAME
setup.types \- epm gui setup types file format.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The EPM
.BR setup (1)
program normally presents the user with a list of software products to install, which is called a "custom" software installation.
.LP
If a file called \fIsetup.types\fR is present in the package directory, the user will instead be presented with a list of installation types.
Each type has an associated product list which determines the products that are installed by default.
If a type has no products associated with it, then it is treated as a custom installation and the user is presented with a list of packages to choose from.
.SH FILE FORMAT
The \fIsetup.types\fR file is an ASCII text file consisting of type and product lines.
Comments can be inserted by starting a line with the pound sign (#).
Each installation type is defined by a line starting with the word TYPE.
Products are defined by a line starting with the word INSTALL:
.LP
.nf
TYPE Typical End-User Configuration
INSTALL foo
INSTALL foo-help
TYPE Typical Developer Configuration
INSTALL foo
INSTALL foo-help
INSTALL foo-devel
INSTALL foo-examples
TYPE Custom Configuration
.fi
.LP
In the example above, three installation types are defined.
Since the last type includes no products, the user will be presented with the full list of products to choose from.
